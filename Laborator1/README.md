# Project 1

This project implements the basic functionalities of an Ethereum wallet. It shows the balance of an account and allows transfers. It relies on the MetaMask extension.

## Denominations

Smaller denominations of Ether easier to use in transactions since transactions usually involve less than 1 eth:
- 1 Ether = 103 Finney
- 1 Ether = 109 Gwei
- 1 Ether = 1018 Wei

## General Observations - ETH wallets

Private keys should be kept on users’ device (hot wallet), never stored on server-side. In Metamask keys are stored in browser’s files and may be recovered with a mnemonic phrase.

## Getting started

### MetaMask accounts
Open the MetaMask browser extension and create at least two Ethereum accounts for the Sepolia testnet. We should be able to demonstrate transfers between accounts. 

### Get Sepolia ETH
Get Sepolia ETH from https://sepolia-faucet.pk910.de/.

### Run the client app with npm 
Clone the git repository and run:

```
npm install
```

```
npm start
```


## Components

The application has two main components:
- **Welcome page**: This page presents generic information and a button that will create a wallet based on the connection with MetaMask.
- **Wallet page**: This page shows the balance of the account connected with MetaMask. It also opens a form as a pop-up that allows for ETH transfers. 

In App.js, you'll find a RouterProvider for navigation between the two components and a Context providing a Wallet, which is the WalletContext encapsulating a WalletProvider.

The implementation for the WalletContext is found in utils/Context.js

### Wallet Context provides: 
- **initializeWallet**: a callback function to instantiate the wallet. This function is called in the Welcome page after a successful connection to the MetaMask Wallet.
- **wallet**: the account connected with MetaMask, i.e., the signer of the transactions.

### Ether Library

Wallet functionalities are added in utils/EthersUtils.js.

https://docs.ethers.org/v5/

Ethers is a library for interacting with the Ethereum Blockchain and its ecosystem. 

The classes most developers will use are Provider and Wallet. 

The following code instantiates a BrowserProvider .i.e. MetaMask. We get the active account (the signer Wallet) by calling 'eth_requestAccounts' on the provider.

```js
const ethers = require('ethers');

const provider = new ethers.BrowserProvider(window.ethereum);


if (window.ethereum) {
    provider.send("eth_requestAccounts", []).then(async () => {
      provider.getSigner().then(async (account) => {
        //use account ;
      });
    }
    ).catch(async () => { console.log("err"); });
  } else {
    console.log("err");
}

```

A Wallet can load a private key directly or from any common wallet format. We use the wallet to send transactions. Each transaction has a recipient and a value.

```js
const transactionResponse = await wallet.sendTransaction({
    to,
    value: ethers.parseUnits(amount.toString(), 'wei')
});
```

## Assignment: 

Add functionalities to get the amount of gas spent for a  transaction, the block number, and the block timestamp of the block in which the transaction is included. 

Use the transaction hash returned by wallet.sendTransaction and the Etherscan API.

## Getting Started with Create React App [readme generated by create react app]

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
